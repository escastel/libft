# Your very first own library ðŸ“–
This is your first project as a student at 42.

You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.

This project is about understanding the way these functions work,
implementing and learning to use them. Your will create your own library. It will be
helpful since you will use it in your next C school assignments.
