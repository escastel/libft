# Your First Library!ðŸ“–
This is your first project as a student at 42.

You will need to program some functions from the C standard library, as well as other functions that will be useful throughout your cursus.

This project will allow you to understand how these functions work, how to implement them, and learn how to use them. You will create your own library, which will be very useful as you will use it in the subsequent C projects.
